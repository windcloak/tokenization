# Tokenization
 This program will parse a text file, tokenize the contents, and count the number of occurences of each token.
* The content will be stored into 2 parallel arrays: one array with the token, and one array with the token count.
* User is able to choose a second input file of words to be ignored. 
* User can then select a location/file name for analysis output to be stored.
* The analysis will include a sorted list of tokens, along with the occurence counts of each lower-case token, separated by commas.
